I can draw conclusions from Barack Obama's video speech entitled The Importance of Education, he teaches how important education is, how to solve unimaginable problems, not to learn material in school that will be useful or not someday, but how do we solve these problems . In addition, he taught how important it is to follow the existing rules and understand what those rules are.
