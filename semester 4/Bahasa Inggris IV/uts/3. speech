Togetherness in Economic Recovery
Today, let us together express praise and gratitude to the Presence of Allah SWT for all the abundance of His grace, grace and guidance, so that UNPAM can continuously develop itself, and expand its work for the progress of the nation and state, as well as for the benefit of society. world. Let's convey our highest appreciation to the founders of UNPAM who have laid the foundation of a scientific culture for UNPAM, and oversee the development of UNPAM from time to time with all the challenges it faces.
UNPAM was born, grew and developed, through the struggle of all the best sons and daughters of the Indonesian nation from various regions and ethnicities, from all over the archipelago. UNPAM was born in diversity, and grows and develops in diversity. In this diversity, the nation's best sons and daughters unite to realize a common goal.
Distinguished guests,
Today, more than a year we have been through a time full of uncertainty and challenges, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the document "Platform for Shaping the Future of the New Economy and Society" published by the World Economic Forum, by the turn of the year 2020/2021 it was noted that confirmed cases of COVID-19 had exceeded 77 million, with more than 1.67 deaths related to COVID-19. These figures illustrate the significance of the world health crisis posed by the pandemic.
In addition to the health crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic has also caused a world economic crisis. Social restriction measures taken by various countries to control the spread of COVID-19 have caused economic contraction in various countries. The economic contraction began with a decline in market demand as a result of restrictions on various social activities. Many companies, both large, medium and small, have experienced over-supply, and this has resulted in financial difficulties. As a further consequence, many workers lost their jobs, so that unemployment and poverty rates also increased. In turn, this has all led to various social impacts.
Currently we in Indonesia, as well as the entire world community, are entering the vaccination phase. By the end of 2020, a number of COVID-19 vaccines had obtained approval for production, and in early 2021 they had begun to be distributed. However, the supply of vaccines is still very limited, so that the distribution of vaccines cannot be comprehensive and even. This inequality does not only occur within a country, but also across countries. The limited supply and inequality of this vaccine will certainly bring consequences in the process of economic recovery. However, we all hope that with this vaccination, we can gradually control the spread of COVID-19 to a minimal level.
In a video message delivered at The Global Vaccine Summit, UN Secretary General António Guterres emphasized, "We need global solidarity to ensure that every person, everywhere, has access". Guterres emphasized that when a COVID-19 vaccine became available, “…it reaches everyone.” The UN Secretary General's message underlined a key word related to the post-pandemic period, namely: solidarity.
Distinguished guests,
Please allow me to take this valuable opportunity to convey things that are expected to be our common challenges in the post-pandemic period.
With vaccinations, people's immunity will gradually increase, and the health crisis will decrease, or end. This will lead to confidence in us to restart activities that involve face-to-face interaction. Social mobility will gradually increase. And all of this will lead to demand for various goods and services. The re-growth of market demand is a key factor for economic recovery. However, the re-growth of demand will not necessarily lead to a rapid economic recovery.
Various companies that are experiencing financial difficulties as a result of the pandemic, need time to be able to recover their business activities. The speed of business recovery will vary from one company to another, from one economic sector to another. This is also influenced by the speed and evenness of the vaccination process. This means that in the future we will live a period of economic recovery accompanied by uncertainties and challenges.
If you refer to the documents published earlier by the World Economic Forum, there are several notes regarding the period of economic recovery. First, as a result of the damage that occurred during the pandemic, it is not certain that all economic sectors will be able to be fully recovered, and return to the way they were in the pre-pandemic period. Second, our experience of going through a pandemic has become a source ofnew inspiration, which in turn will lead to demand for new goods/services. Third, in the pre-pandemic period, not all conditions were ideal. There are many economic, social and environmental problems that existed in the pre-pandemic period, which will remain a problem in the post-pandemic period. In other words, the process of economic recovery will be accompanied by the emergence of hopes for new conditions, or improvements to conditions in the pre-pandemic period.
For example, in the past we had limited experience with digital learning and remote working. During the pandemic, we are doing digital learning and remote working very intensively, with all its advantages and disadvantages. Although in the post-pandemic period most of the activities will return to face-to-face or off-line interaction patterns, there is the possibility of new exploration in the use of digital technology. This pandemic period provides inspiration to explore opportunities for using digital technology more inclusively, and pay more attention to the resilience aspect.
This pandemic period has also shown that the MSME sector, especially small and micro businesses, is not sufficiently resilient, and is not sufficiently capable of creating added value. This will be a trigger for us to pay more attention to increasing the resilience and innovation ability of MSMEs. Global trade conditions in the pre-pandemic period, limited our opportunities to develop domestic products. Such conditions are expected to change in the direction of trade deglobalization. These changing conditions open up opportunities for us to encourage domestic production, both for the needs of the domestic and export markets, through bilateral/multilateral trade cooperation. All of these things open up new opportunities, and at the same time pose challenges for us in the period of national economic recovery.
Distinguished guests,
In organizing Tri Dharma activities during the pandemic, UNPAM prioritizes the principle of safety first, to provide protection for all academics and UNPAM educational staff. Of course this will result in a decrease in performance, even though UNPAM has made maximum efforts so that the decline in performance is not significant. I believe that all the shortcomings that occurred during the pandemic, we will be able to recover the condition, or we can make it better, in the post-pandemic period. The condition is that our condition is still healthy.
Since early 2021, the Indonesian government has rolled out a national vaccination program. In this regard, UNPAM has participated in the Vaccination Festival organized by the Ministry of Health and Local Government. UNPAM is committed to contributing to the success of the national program.
UNPAM's research and community service program for 2021, and perhaps the next few years, will pay attention to activities that support the national economic recovery program. We don't know exactly what kind of economic recovery strategy is the most appropriate. We need a learning by doing and learning by experimentation approach. In general, there are several areas that can be a priority for our attention. The first is exploring the use of digital technology to support the recovery of the MSME sector. The second is in the fields of health, food and new/renewable energy. The third is increasing the ability to innovate and create added value for the MSME sector, for the purpose of increasing domestic production.
Apart from this, we need to maintain and improve closer and continuous communication and coordination with various parties, so that we can respond more quickly and accurately. Some of the key words in the national economic recovery period are: innovation, resilience, solidarity, and engagement.
In closing, allow me to invite all lecturer colleagues, education staff, and students, to jointly welcome the national economic recovery period while still adhering to health protocols, increasing optimism, creativity and productivity, and maintaining solidarity for the progress of UNPAM and the Indonesian nation.
